# Welcome!
My name is Angela, and I'm a licensed esthetician specializing in facial treatments and sugar waxing. As someone who has acne-prone and sensitive skin, I specialize in acne treatments and rosacea control, using products that help combat acne and soothe the skin. Whether you need waxing, a pampering session, or have particular concerns about your skin, I would love to take care of your skin care needs.
